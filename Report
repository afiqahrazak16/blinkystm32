MILESTONE-1 (REPORT)

Title: Familiarizing with the STM32F4 Development Board

Introduction:
The purpose of this report is to demonstrate how to blink an LED using the Hardware Abstraction Layer 
(HAL) library in conjunction with the STM32 Nucleo development board. In this milestone, we will use a 
delay of 500 milliseconds and the toggle function to control the blinking of an LED.

Hardware Setup:
STM32F410 Nucleo-64 board

Software Setup:
Installed STM32CubeIDE (Integrated Development Environment) on computer.

Implementation:
• Created a new project using STM32F410 NUCLEO-64/NUCLEO-F410RB.
• Open the main.c file in the project.
• Define the GPIO pin that is connected to onboard LED.
• Enter an infinite loop.
• Toggle the state of the LED using the HAL GPIO toggle function.
• Delay for 500 milliseconds using the HAL delay function.

Result:
Upon successfully compiling and uploading the code to the STM32 Nucleo board, the on-board LED 
started blinking with a delay of 500ms.
